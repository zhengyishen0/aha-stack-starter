# Basis: A Foundation for Modern Web Development

Build web applications using fundamental tools with clear architectural boundaries. No framework magic, no hidden complexity - just clean separation of concerns.

## The Philosophy

Every part of your application has a single responsibility and clear boundaries:

- **Design** ‚Üí CSS custom properties with semantic tokens
- **Components** ‚Üí Self-contained HTML + CSS + Alpine.js
- **Pages** ‚Üí Simple composition of components
- **Data** ‚Üí Alpine stores with Supabase
- **Backend** ‚Üí Supabase handles everything
- **Content** ‚Üí Markdown with structured frontmatter

## Why Basis?

Unlike traditional frameworks that add layers of abstraction, Basis uses the web platform's fundamental tools. Each layer can change independently without affecting others. You get the power of modern development with the simplicity of basic tools.

## What's Included

- **65+ Production Components** - UI elements and marketing sections ready to use
- **Complete Design System** - Primitive and semantic tokens, no Tailwind needed
- **Full-Stack Features** - Authentication, real-time data, and CRUD operations
- **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with GitHub Pages deployment

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install && npm run dev`
3. Edit the 4 essential files shown above
4. Deploy with `git push`

That's it. No complex setup, no configuration hell, just start building.
