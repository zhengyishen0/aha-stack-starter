# Welcome to the AHA Stack

This starter project demonstrates the power of combining **Astro**, **HTMX**, **Alpine.js**, and **Pines UI** to create fast, interactive web applications with minimal JavaScript overhead.

## Why the AHA Stack?

The AHA stack (Astro + HTMX + Alpine) represents a return to server-side rendering with carefully applied client-side interactivity. This approach provides:

- **Better Performance**: Less JavaScript means faster loading and better Core Web Vitals
- **Improved SEO**: Server-side rendering ensures content is immediately available to search engines
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Write less boilerplate, focus more on features
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Applications work even when JavaScript fails

## Getting Started

The components above demonstrate the integration between all four technologies. The counter showcases Alpine.js reactivity, while the todo list demonstrates HTMX's server communication capabilities.

Explore the source code to see how these technologies work together seamlessly!
